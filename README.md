## Project Assignments

The `project/` directory contains the main project assignments, which are divided into multiple deliveries. Each delivery is a self-contained project that implements different aspects of distributed systems.

### Current Deliveries

1. **BigFS (Distributed File System)** - `project/entrega_1/`
   - A simple distributed file system implementation using Python sockets
   - Implements basic file operations (list, remove, copy, get)
   - Client-server architecture

## Laboratory Exercises

The `labs/` directory contains practical exercises and experiments that complement the theoretical concepts covered in the course. These exercises help students understand and implement fundamental distributed systems concepts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Note

Each assignment and lab has its own README file with specific instructions, requirements, and usage examples. Please refer to those files for detailed information about each component.
